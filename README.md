# Stardog.tech

Hello! This is a project I started on to continue my coding skills and because  forms kept asking for my personal website and I wanted to have something to show there. 

Originally it was going to be a simple portfolio site but now the plan is to use it to continue learning react and messing around with different ideas. It is very much a work in progress and an extension of my learning. I apolgoize for any dust.

As it has new features added I will update the readme accordingly. :)

 ## Have a nice day!
